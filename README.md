# Pollution and Happiness Analysis

## Overview
This project explores the impact of pollution levels, including CO2 emissions and other environmental factors, on national happiness. Using various datasets, the analysis seeks to uncover relationships between pollution metrics and happiness scores across different countries.

## Key Features
- **Data Integration:** Combining happiness scores, CO2 emissions, and pollution datasets.
- **Visualizations:** Four detailed visualizations highlighting the findings.
- **Ethical Assessment:** Evaluation of the implications of pollution on human well-being.
- **Conclusions and Recommendations:** Actionable insights for policymakers.

## Datasets
The following datasets were utilized:
1. Happiness Score Dataset
2. Pollution Data (CO2 emissions, PM2.5 levels, etc.)

## Methods
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Statistical and graphical analysis to identify trends and correlations.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Infrastructure:** Jupyter Notebook

## Visualizations
1. **Correlation Matrix** showing relationships between happiness and pollution metrics.
2. **Trend Analysis** of happiness scores against CO2 emissions over time.
3. **Country Clustering** based on happiness and pollution levels.
4. **Geographical Heatmap** displaying pollution impact globally.
